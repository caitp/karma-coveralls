# karma-coveralls [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/caitp/karma-coveralls/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/caitp/karma-coveralls) [![dependencies](https://img.shields.io/david/caitp/karma-coveralls.svg?style=flat)](https://david-dm.org/caitp/karma-coveralls) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/caitp/karma-coveralls/master.svg?style=flat)](https://coveralls.io/r/caitp/karma-coveralls?branch=master)

A Karma plugin to upload coverage reports generated by [karma-coverage][karma-coverage] to [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/).

Based on the work on [grunt-karma-coveralls](https://github.com/mattjmorrison/grunt-karma-coveralls),
with the primary difference being that this plugin does not depend on grunt, and simply exists as a
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) plugin.

## Installation

```shell
npm install karma-coveralls --save-dev
```

## Usage

In your karma configuration, ensure your list of reporters contains at the very least `coverage` (see [karma-coverage][karma-coverage]) and `coveralls`, for example:

```js
reporters: ['coverage', 'coveralls']
```

Following this, ensure you are generating lcov reports from the [coverage][karma-coverage] reporter, like so:

```js
coverageReporter: {
type: 'lcov', // lcov or lcovonly are required for generating lcov.info files
dir: 'coverage/'
}
```

And finally, the coveralls reporter depends on some additional configuration, which may be set
via environment variables, karma config options (properties of the `coverallsReporter` object),
or presence in the `.coveralls.yml` configuration file:

```
+-------------------------+------------------------+---------------------+
| ENV VARIABLE            | YAML VARIABLE          | KARMA VARIABLE      |
+-------------------------+------------------------+---------------------+
| `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN`  | `repo_token`           | `repoToken`         |
+-------------------------+------------------------+---------------------+
```

Please note that it is NOT recommended to save your repo token in plain text for everyone to see.
Treat it like a password. If you need to include it in a public repo you should [encrypt it](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Secure-Variables).

Be patiant when sending coverage information to coveralls, it can take upto 4 hours for things to
start showing up properly.
